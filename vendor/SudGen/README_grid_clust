Here we report the operations to run parallel pretabulations on lxplus

0) make sure that correct information on the PY path is stored in makefile.inc;
   one can also run pythia_path.py to retrieve information from the
   mg5_configuration.txt file 

1) make gridsudgen_clust

2) edit run_gridsudgen.sh with the desired input parameters
   (how many mass points, type of dipoles and particles)

3) ./condor_submit_gridsudgen.sh
   this step submits jobs on lxplus; at the end of the jobs one gets
   files called grid_i_j.txt (i=itype, j=ipart)

4) make gridsudcomb

5) ./gridsudcomb < input
   where 'input' must have the same parameters as those used in
   run_gridsudgen.sh; this step copies the content of the grid_i_j.txt
   files to the final sudakov.f output file
