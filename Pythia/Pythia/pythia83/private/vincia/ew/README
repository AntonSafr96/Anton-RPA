This directory contains some scripts that are used to numerically determine several types of 
overestimates that are used by the EW shower. 
The easiest way to run them is to copy them over to examples/ together with the directory EWoverestimates, which contains several required files.
Below is a description of the individual scripts.

1) The program main-generate-EW-FF-overestimates.cc is responsible for generating the overestimates 
of the FF and FFres antenna functions that are used by the EW shower. 
For every type of branching that may occur in the EW theory, the program generates a number of random
branchings from antennae with randomly generated antenna masses. 
The code then interfaces to a python script, where a Linear Programming problem is formulated 
and solved using the generated data. 
The result is communicated back to the main program, where it is written to the files 'EWoverestimates/branchingsFF.xml' and 'EWioverestimates/branchingsFFres.xml'.
The data in these files should then end up in 'share/Pythia8/xmldoc/VinciaEW.xml', from where they are loaded into the shower. 
Note that the python script makes use of the package PuLP, which can simply be installed by running 'pip3 install pulp'. 

2) The program main-generate-EW-II-overestimates.cc does the same thing for II antenna functions. 
However, due to their simplicity, no Linear Programming solver is required, and the results are immediately written to 

3) The program main-generate-EW-BW-overestimates.cc generates overestimates used during rejection sampling of the Breit-Wigner distributions
when generating off-shell masses for the resonances produced by the EW shower. 
It performs a simple uniform scan over the parameters of the Breit-Wigner overestimate and stores the best-performing result. 
The coefficients c0 - c3 are hard-coded into VinciaEW.cc as the map cBW.
